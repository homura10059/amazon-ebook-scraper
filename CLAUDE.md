# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Amazon ebook scraper project that appears to be in the initial setup phase. Based on the repository name and structure, this will likely be a Node.js application for scraping ebook data from Amazon.

## Current State

The repository is currently empty with only:
- Empty README.md
- Standard Node.js .gitignore
- Git repository initialized

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, typical Node.js development commands will likely be:
- `npm init` - Initialize package.json
- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - Development server (once configured)
- `npm test` - Run tests (once configured)
- `npm run build` - Build for production (once configured)

## Notes

This project is in the initial setup phase. Future updates to this file should include:
- Package manager commands once package.json is created
- Testing framework commands once tests are set up
- Build and deployment processes once configured
- Architecture details once the codebase is developed
